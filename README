===============================

The last time I was able to update this repo was October 30, 2023. Since
then, the original CVS repo has been unavailable. In theory, one day
PCC will return.  We can only keep hoping.

============================

This Git repo is a simple mirror of the CVS repositories for the PCC
Revived project (but without the 'CVS' directories).

This project is a revival of the venerable Unix Portable C Compiler. It
adds C 99 and general GCC compatbility with code generators for i386
and x86_64 among others. The home page is:

	http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/

For installing, you have to first build and install the pcc-libs,
and then build and install pcc. The usual configure && make incantation
is used.  For instructions using CVS, see:

	http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/supported-platforms/

The mailing list for reporting errors is: pcc@lists.ludd.ltu.se.

The JIRA is

I am creating this Git repo so that I can access the code via HTTP(S)
from behind the corporate firewall at my work. There are no other
motives.
